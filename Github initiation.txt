Git commands

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Comment"
git push origin main

#####

This error occurs because Git needs to know your identity before it can commit changes. Git uses this information to associate commits with an author. Let me help you resolve this issue.

You need to set your Git identity with the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Replace "your-email@example.com" with the email address you use for GitHub and "Your Name" with your actual name.

If you only want to set this identity for the current repository (not globally), you can remove the `--global` flag:

```bash
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"
```

After running these commands, you should be able to commit and push to your GitHub repository without encountering this error.

Would you like me to explain any other Git configuration options that might be helpful for your setup?

You're encountering an SSH authentication error when trying to push to GitHub. This happens because GitHub requires you to set up SSH keys for secure authentication. Let me walk you through the setup process:

1. First, check if you already have SSH keys:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   ```

2. If you don't have existing keys (or want to create new ones), generate a new SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```
   (Use the same email you configured for Git)

3. Start the SSH agent in the background:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

4. Add your private key to the SSH agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

5. Copy your public key to clipboard (you'll need to display it first):
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Copy the output, which starts with `ssh-ed25519` and ends with your email.

6. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to GitHub.com and log in
   - Click your profile photo → Settings
   - In the sidebar, click "SSH and GPG keys"
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Give your key a descriptive title
   - Paste your key into the "Key" field
   - Click "Add SSH key"

7. Test your connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   
8. If your repository is already set up with HTTPS instead of SSH, you'll need to change the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```
   Replace "username/repository.git" with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

After completing these steps, try pushing again with `git push origin main`.
